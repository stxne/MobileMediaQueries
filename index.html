        <h1>STREETWEAR EDITION</h1>
        <p>Before streetwear was a multibillion dollar industry run by white men--and their pretentiously, exclusive, luxury brands--it was a cultural phenomenon and movement shaped by Black culture.  Streetwear emerged in the 1980, specifically in New York City, shortly after the birth of Hip-Hop. Without a doubt, there is a direct link between streetwear and hip-hop. As Hip-hop spread through new York city  and made its way into mainstream media so did streetwear.<br><br>This is where we begin to see the emergence of streetwear brands and designers, such as Dapper Dan who started selling his designs and clothes to rappers in New York city. Much like Hip-hop, streetwear was an artistic expression and a way of marginalized communities, specifically black and brown, of breaking tradition and conformity, so it is very cultural and political as well. </p>

        <h1>STREETWEAR<br>TODAY</h1>
        <div class="bodyContent">
          <h3>Today streetwear has been widely popularized and is no longer specific to the black and brown communities  of New York City nor hip-hop culture.</h3>
          <p>Some popular streetwear trends you may see today are bucket hats, oversized clothing, scripted necklaces, hoop earring, sneaker culture, and logomania or monogram print, these can all be directly traced back to black and brown communities.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="logoMania">
        <p>You might have seen monogram print on some luxury brands Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dior, etc. This trend as we know it today really only exists among exclusive, wealthy, luxury brands and is often associated with wealth and high class. But it is a fact that monogram print was started by the one and only Dapper Dan, who is one of the pioneers of streetwear. In Harlem, NY, in the 1980s,  Dapper Dan would illegally screen print designer brand logos into this logomania patter and would print on clothing, linen,  furniture, etc. He had huge support from the hip-hop and rap community and had big clients such as Jay Z, P Diddy, and LL Cool J.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Sneaker culture is a subculture within streetwear that is bug industry today and has, and its way into mainstream fashion and even high fashion. Sneaker culture emerged shortly before streetwear, in the 1970s as sport wear became a thing, but was not popularized or established until the 1980 after the growth of hip-hop and streetwear. As well as the popularization of basketball. These shoes were predominantly worn by black and brown kids . This trend birthed a generation of sneakerheads we know today. </p>

      <div class="conclusion">
        <div class="greenBG">
          <h1>GHETTO TILL<br>PROVEN WHITE</h1>
          <p>The erasure of Black people in streetwear culture today is astronomical. The industry is run by white men who own some of the biggest brands in streetwear such as Supreme, Nike, and Adidas. The brands profit off of styles  started by black people, but tend to leave black people out of the conversation and out of their companies. Even if streetwear is no longer exclusive to Black culture it is important that these brands recognize its history. The styles that make companies millions of dollars are the same styles that are labeled as ghetto when worn on Black people and put Black people into some nasty stereotypes, even go as far as getting black people killed for looking “thuggish” or making white people “fear" for their lives.  Remember it was a hoodie that made Trayvon Martin appear as a “suspicious guy”. What is seen as a trendy hoody on a white man, the same hoodie can be a threat on a black man. </p>
